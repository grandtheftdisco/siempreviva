# ===== GIT REBASING EXPLAINED =====
# Rebasing is like moving your building to a new foundation

# Main branch:
#   Floor C (newest)
#   Floor B
#   Floor A (foundation)

# Your branch started from Floor A and built:
#   Your Floor F
#   Your Floor E
#   Your Floor D
#   -------
#   Floor A (old foundation)

# After rebasing:
#   Your Floor F
#   Your Floor E
#   Your Floor D
#   -------
#   Floor C (new stuff from main)
#   Floor B (new stuff from main)
#   Floor A (original foundation)

# KEY POINTS:
# - Your work stays in order (D, E, F)
# - It's just built on top of new foundation (B, C)
# - NOT like shuffling/mixing - your commits stay together
# - Conflicts = both you and main changed the same thing

# Rebasing steps:
# 1. git checkout your-branch
# 2. git branch your-branch-backup  (safety!)
# 3. git rebase main
# 4. Fix conflicts if any
# 5. git add [fixed-files]
# 6. git rebase --continue
# 7. git push origin your-branch --force-with-lease

# Emergency abort:
# git rebase --abort

# ===== AFTER REBASING: STARSHIP UI SYMBOLS =====
# ~/dev/siempreviva on 🌱 amanda/marketing-views [📦⇕⇡4⇣3]
#
# ⇡4 = 4 commits ahead (to push)
# ⇣3 = 3 commits behind (to pull)
#
# IMPORTANT: After rebasing, DO NOT pull!
# - ⇡ = your rebased commits (correct, new foundation)
# - ⇣ = old pre-rebase commits on remote (outdated)
# - Pulling would undo your rebase and create a mess!
# - Instead: force push with --force-with-lease

# ===== FORCE PUSH SAFELY =====
# git push origin your-branch --force-with-lease
#
# --force-with-lease vs --force:
# - --force: Blindly overwrites remote (dangerous if others pushed)
# - --force-with-lease: Checks if remote changed since your last pull
#   - If someone else pushed: rejects (protects their work)
#   - If no changes: allows force push (safe)
#
# After rebase, local and remote diverged:
# - Local = correct (rebased on new foundation)
# - Remote = outdated (old foundation)
# - Force push = tell GitHub "my local is truth"
#
# Common mistake: Seeing ⇡⇣ and pulling = rebase loop hell!
# Solution: Always force-with-lease after rebasing

# ===== RESOLVING CONFLICTS: --ours vs --theirs =====
# CONFUSING: These flags mean OPPOSITE things in rebase vs merge!
#
# During REBASE (git rebase main):
# - --ours   = version from branch you're rebasing ONTO (main)
# - --theirs = version from YOUR branch (the one being rebased)
#
# During MERGE (git merge feature-branch):
# - --ours   = version from YOUR current branch
# - --theirs = version from branch being merged in
#
# Example from rebase:
# git checkout --theirs CSS_REFACTOR_PLAN.md
# = "Keep my branch's version, discard main's version"
#
# Quick resolution commands:
# git checkout --ours <file>    # Keep destination branch version
# git checkout --theirs <file>  # Keep your branch version
# git add <file>                # Mark as resolved
# git rebase --continue         # Continue rebase
#
# TIP: During rebase, think backwards:
# - "theirs" = yours (your branch)
# - "ours" = destination (main)
