# Archived Session Plans

This directory contains session plans that have been superseded or restructured.

## Files

### `session_4e_semantic_grouping.md`
**Original:** Session 4E - Apply Semantic Grouping Pattern
**Now:** Session 5B (moved due to priority changes)
**Reason:** Specificity cleanup must happen before semantic grouping to avoid reorganizing code twice

### `session_5_specificity_cleanup.md`
**Original:** Session 5 - Specificity Cleanup (estimated 2-3 hours)
**Now:** Restructured into Sessions 5A, 5B, and 5C
**Reason:** Comprehensive audit revealed scope was much larger (12-15+ hours). Split into blocking work (5A) and deferred polish (5B/5C) to prioritize MVP timeline.
