# ü™ª Welcome to Siempreviva!
- This is my second webdev project: an ecommerce site for a small business.

## ‚öíÔ∏è UNDER CONSTRUCTION 
- I'm building this project as you read this, so watch the repo or check back often to see my progress!
  
- üìÜ **5/9/25**
  - No code review this week: this feature is taking longer than I thought!
  - I'm still working on implementing my first service object, which will itemize a cart's contents, as well as any discounts/shipping/taxes, and then calculate a total
  - I've been writing this class with TDD, which has been a great experience so far.
  - It's been a challenge to estimate how much time it will take to build features.
    - This one is certainly taking longer than I anticipated, but I'm learning a lot: and seeing just how much work goes into the back-end of an app.
  - I've been strengthening my command of Ruby, too.
    - `dig` and `sum` came to the rescue today!
    - Nested collections are tricky, but I'm committed to understanding my way around them.
- üìÜ **5/2/25**
  - I've got a bare-bones version of my checkout flow wired up. It's not pretty, but it works!
  - What's next?
    - I'm preparing to refactor some of my controller logic for cart updates into a service object.
    - I've also got plans to implement a 2nd service object that will soft-delete a `Cart` & its associated `Checkout` object when a Stripe `PaymentIntent` is marked as `succeeded`

# PROCESS

## Goals
- My main goal with this project is to challenge myself beyond my comfort zone.
- I want to take what I've learned from [Henventory](https://www.github.com/grandtheftdisco/henventory) and use it as a foundation to build something more complex.

## Team
- I could **never** call this a solo project and be able to sleep at night.
- My technical mentor Bookis, as always, has been indispensable throughout the process.
- I'm also extremely grateful for the feedback that the Siempreviva owners gave me during the design process.
  - It's not often you get to build something for a real customer this early in your webdev journey!
  - Thank you to these wonderful women for giving me a chance.

## Stack
- Ruby on Rails
- Postgres
- Stripe API
- Stripe.js
- _Stimulus.js_ (projected)
- Tailwind
- _Render_ (projected deployment platform)

## Timeframe
- March 2025 - now
- Admittedly, it's hard to forecast how long this project will take, since it's my first one that's this complex.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Got some advice for me?
- I'm all ears!
