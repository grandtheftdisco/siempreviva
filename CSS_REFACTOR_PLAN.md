# CSS Refactoring Project

**⚠️ This file has been reorganized for better navigation**

## New Location

The CSS refactoring documentation has been reorganized into a structured directory for easier navigation:

📁 **[project_plan/](./project_plan/README.md)** - Start here for the main overview

## Quick Links

## Why Reorganized?

The original CSS_REFACTOR_PLAN.md was 670+ lines and hard to navigate. The new structure:

✅ Easier to find specific information
✅ Session-based organization matches workflow
✅ Technical docs separated from project plan
✅ Better for ongoing maintenance
